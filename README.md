# Reading goals

Works with Epilogue's Goals feature. Adds book covers to a post or page from your yearly reading goals using the Hugo shortcode `{{< bookgoals 2022 >}}` where 2022 is the year to use. It will gather up any finished books for that year and display them, linking each cover to your blog post.
